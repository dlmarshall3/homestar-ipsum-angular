    <p>On April 28th, 2022, I (David) shared the following screenshot in a group chat full of guys I've known for over twenty years:</p>

    <p>I had been working through some of my coursework on Python/Flask, and when it came to the "compliment generator," I knew I had to go with some Homestar-based adjectives. You know, like, "punchable" and "technochocolatey." I stepped away for a bit, and when I came back, one of my friends, Sean, said, "Oooh, we need some Homestar Ipsum!" And after the conversation had percolated a bit, I thought, "...why don't I make this?"</p>
    
    <p>After some quick research, I found a <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/creating-a-lorem-ipsum-generator-with-node-and-express-9e1af0b31c86">great tutorial</a> for building your own Lorem Ipsum generator, and I went to town shortly after. Thus the Homestar Ipsum Generator version 1.0 was born! However, after learning Angular for my current job, I decided to refactor the application, which had previously required Node.js, among other things. (Heroku removing their free tier and me being lazy didn't hurt.) What you see now is version 2.0, and I am much, much happier with the result.</p>
    
    <p>(In addition to refactoring the application in Angular, I actually turned the entire generator into a npm package, which you can download <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/homestar-ipsum">here</a>. This makes updating this application much easier: when I decide to add new emails, I only have to update the package, not both applications. It was a lot of fun publishing the package, and I'm looking forward to making more.)</p>
    
    <p>That said, I recognize there are definitely going to be decisions made with this app that, if I was tackling something more "sacred," like the MCU or Star Wars, people would take offense to, such as where I might break up certain lines, or if I forget (or neglect) to use some of the extraneous dialogue. Part of this will be the result of me only doing a few at a time, so I'll forget what I did with emails prior. Because in full transparency, I am copying and pasting everything from the <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/">HRWiki</a>, so if there is any fault, it's on me and me alone.</p>
    
    <p>In all seriousness, this project wouldn't even be possible without everyone who has invested their time and resources into the wiki. Y'all are saints. Also, a big thank you to Sean, Zach, Matt, and Frank for entertaining the idea and for the feedback. Crazy to think we've all known each other for almost thirty years and how Homestar has been a pivotal part of that friendship. And, of course, to the Brothers Chaps. Who knew those Flash cartoons back in the day would end up becoming what they did.</p>
    
    <p>(And yes, I misspelled Stiny. Sue me. Or don't. Please don't.)</p>
